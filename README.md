Title: Monty Hall Problem: A Probability Puzzle

The Monty Hall problem is a captivating probability puzzle inspired by the American game show "Let's Make a Deal," hosted by Monty Hall. It challenges our intuition and understanding of probability in a seemingly paradoxical scenario.

Here's the setup:

Three doors are presented, behind which are hidden two goats and one car.
You, the contestant, choose one of the doors.
The host, Monty Hall, who knows what lies behind each door, then reveals one of the remaining doors, always showing a goat.
Now comes the crucial decision: Do you stick with your initial choice or switch to the other unopened door?
Contrary to intuition, the optimal strategy is to switch doors. This choice yields a winning probability of 2/3, while sticking with the original door only offers a 1/3 chance of winning. The apparent paradox arises because our initial assumptions about the probabilities are incorrect.

The Monty Hall problem gained widespread attention in 1990 when it was featured in the Ask Marilyn column in Parade magazine. It has since become a classic example used to illustrate the principles of probability and the impact of new information on decision-making.

To explore and understand the dynamics of the Monty Hall problem, <b>you can run the provided code in the repository named "mont_hall_goats.py."</b> This Python script demonstrates the probabilities involved and showcases how different strategies affect the outcome.

Join the quest to unravel the mysteries of probability and challenge your intuition with the Monty Hall problem.
